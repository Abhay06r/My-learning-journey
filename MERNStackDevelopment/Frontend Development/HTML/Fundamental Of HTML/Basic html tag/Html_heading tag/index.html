<!-- Problem statement
Apply the concept of heading and paragraph tags to populate the blog page. Use the appropriate tags in the given HTML code to get the Expected Output as shown.



Expected Output:

Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming
Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules.

PREREQUISITES
In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even if it is completed.

COMMENTING
Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers.

TESTING
Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding.

Note

The main heading should have an "h1" heading and the subsequent headings should have headings "h2" and "h3".


Test Cases

1. The main heading 'Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming' should be enclosed within the h1 tag. 

2. The heading name 'PREREQUISITES' should be in the h2 tag. 

3. The Subheadings with the names 'COMMENTING' & 'TESTING' should be in the h3 tag. 

4. All Subheadings should be in the correct order. The order should be in the following manner:

  "COMMENTING"
  "TESTING"

5. There should be exactly 4 paragraphs present and they should be enclosed in the 'p' tag. -->
